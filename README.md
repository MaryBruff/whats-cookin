## 💭 Abstract
What's Cooking (renamed Discory Cooking) is an application that allows users to view and filter recipes by tags and search for recipes by ingredients or name. The recipe cards that show up have the required ingredients for each recipe, the instructions on how to make it, and the cost. This enables users to know what they need to make a particular recipe. 

## 📝  Context
We were a group of three currently in mod 2 at the Turing School of Software and Design. We had 11 days to complete 3 iterations of this project with optional extensions. It took roughly 25 hours.

## 🔧  Setup
- Clone down this repository to your local computer [What's Cookin Link](https://github.com/Jnguyen615/whats-cookin)
- Navigate to 
- CD into the project directory
- In your terminal, run npm install and then npm start
- go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to view and run the application

## 📚 Learning Goals
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information 
- Write dry, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data 
- Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are heard and are contributing to the project


## 🥇 Wins

- Working collaboratively to finish the project ahead of time and with minor additional functionality added. 
- Having open communication that was reciprocated and taken into consideration 
- Prompt communication, always responding to messages on time
- Being able to work together in a way that was productive and manageable 
- Being able to work solo and handle all merge conflicts when encountered together
- Implementing a new design for when the recipe page is printed

## 🚧 Challenges
- Create multiple filters that add additional recipes to the list without creating any duplicates
- Implementing the API call and understanding what areas of the application to be within the promise 
- Getting the data model set up in a way where the promise.all() holds the global object with the data so it can be used throughout the files
